makedup is a Poser Python Script that is intended to allow quick duplication of the current figure. The duplicate figures take their position, rotation and scale from props placed in the scene.

This script requires Poser to run. It has only been tested on Poser v11 Windows version

Instructions.
Add figure
Create animation if different poses are required
create a prop (low poly with something indicative of rotation - eg teapot)
Rename the prop "dragon_1"
Set the position, scale, rotation of dragon_1
Duplicate dragon_1 and call it dragon_2
Set the position, scale, rotation of dragon_2
Repeat above as required.
Select a figure (does not currently work on props)
Run the makedup script. 
The script will run and generate the new duplicates with display type set to outline (will render ok)
