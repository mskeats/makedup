makedup is a Poser Python Script that is intended to allow quick duplication of the current figure. The duplicate figures take their position, rotation and scale from props placed in the scene.

This script requires Poser to run. It has only been tested on Poser v11 Windows version

Instructions.

Set the position, scale, rotation of dragon_1
Duplicate dragon_1 and call it dragon_2
Set the position, scale, rotation of dragon_2
Repeat above as required.
Run the makedup script. 
The figures will be hidden
Either double click on the prop or select "show all" to display figure.
